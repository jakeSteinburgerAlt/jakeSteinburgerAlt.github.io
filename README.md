Website for SpecOS

Currently just an "in construction" page with some basic info about SpecOS cos I was bored and was on another computer so I couldn't work on actual SpecOS. Tbh it's a pretty shit website with just a bit of information about SpecOS.

It really makes more sense to just go to the GitHub repository of SpecOS (here)[https://github.com/jakeSteinburger/SpecOS], because it contains far more information. Don't look too much into this repo, it's useless.

Also, there was a suprising amount of JS for such a simple webpage, cos I had to calculate the right angle and length of the ribbons to fit the screen with some random geometry.
